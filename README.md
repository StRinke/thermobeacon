# thermobeacon
Python script to scan temperatures and humidity from a Thermobeacon, also known as "Wireless Thermometer Hygrometer".

If you have one of these devices:
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thermometer-Hygrometer-ORIA-Bluetooth-Temperature/dp/B08DL5NN58/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=hygrometer&qid=1609604628&sr=8-9

then these scripts might be of some interest to you.

thermobeacon.py scans for all available bluetooth devices, matches the specific device addresses that you provide, then pulls the current temperature and humidity from the manufacturer's data, reporting to stdout and writing values to a csv file.

thermobeacon2.py connects to a specific device and uses specific bluetooth handles to write commands and read responses from the device in order to determine how many data points are available on the device then reads them all, converting from hex values stored in the returned byte arrays to temperatures and humidities.

As discussed on this thread: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=283011

You'll need to install the bluepy Python library (https://pypi.org/project/bluepy/).

thermobeacon.py update with more elegant code (thanks fleminra), and now logs up time (in days) and battery voltage (hopefully, time will tell if this is what that field is)
